Page load times were long on a project I was working on (3 – 5 minutes long) and so I would work on something else. I found that I was wasting a lot of time because the page would load and I wouldn’t know or I would be checking it constantly. So I created this extension to alert me when it loaded.
The extension can be downloaded from the Google Chrome Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-notifier/jlgpcifoopoclbjinllhjonkgpjdmphf
